The purpose of this lab was to demonstrate my proficiency in the following services provided by AWS: IAM, EC2, EBS, CloudFront and Route 53. I used all 5 of these services to create security groups, inbound rules, virtual PCs, load balancers and DNS entries within AWSâ€™s administrative console and tie them all together. I attached screenshots of the configuration settings in the attached file.
